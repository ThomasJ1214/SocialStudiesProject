                    <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti was born in the small italian village of Caprese. He was raised in Florence, where his early life was marked by his mother's death when he was six years old. His father sent him to live with a stonecutter's family, sparking his early exposure to the craft. Growing up in the politically vibrant atmosphere of Florence, Michelangelo became deeply influenced by the Medici family, who acted as his patrons and introduced him to prominent intellectual and artistic circles. He was known for his intense focus, solitary nature, and deep religious devotion, which often shaped his interactions and decisions. Michelangelo never married or had children, dedicating his life entirely to his craft and maintaining a frugal and humble lifestyle despite his immense fame.</p>

                    <p>Michelangelo’s most famous works show his incredible talent in sculpture and painting. On the left is the statue of David, a 17-foot marble figure that represents strength and beauty, while on the right is the Pietà, which shows Mary holding Jesus after the Crucifixion, full of deep emotion and detail. He also painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment, which are considered some of the greatest artworks in history. These masterpieces continue to amaze people and show why Michelangelo is one of the most important artists of all time.</p>
