                    <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti was born in the small italian village of Caprese. He was raised in Florence, where his early life was marked by his mother's death when he was six years old. His father sent him to live with a stonecutter's family, sparking his early exposure to the craft. Growing up in the politically vibrant atmosphere of Florence, Michelangelo became deeply influenced by the Medici family, who acted as his patrons and introduced him to prominent intellectual and artistic circles. He was known for his intense focus, solitary nature, and deep religious devotion, which often shaped his interactions and decisions. Michelangelo never married or had children, dedicating his life entirely to his craft and maintaining a frugal and humble lifestyle despite his immense fame.</p>

He also painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment, which are considered some of the greatest artworks in history. These masterpieces continue to amaze people and show why Michelangelo is one of the most important artists of all time.</p>

                    <p>The Creation of Adam is one of Michelangelo’s most famous paintings, showing God reaching out to give life to Adam. The nearly touching hands symbolize the connection between humans and the divine, representing the gift of life and intelligence. The detailed figures and flowing movement make it one of the most recognized images in art history.</p>

                    <img src="last-judgment.jpg" alt="The Last Judgment">
                    <p>The Last Judgment is a large and dramatic painting on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, depicting Christ’s return to judge all souls. The painting shows the saved rising to heaven while the damned are pulled down into hell, creating a powerful sense of movement and emotion. Michelangelo used strong expressions and muscular figures to emphasize the intensity of this final moment.</p>

                    <p>The ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel are a series of paintings that tell stories from the Book of Genesis, including The Creation of Adam. The ceiling is filled with detailed images of prophets, sibyls, and biblical scenes, showing Michelangelo’s incredible skill in composition and anatomy. These frescoes transformed the chapel into one of the most breathtaking artistic achievements of the Renaissance.</p>

                    <img src="expulsion-of-eden.jpg" alt="The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden">
                    <p>The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden captures the painful moment when Adam and Eve are cast out of paradise after disobeying God. Michelangelo uses light and shadow to highlight their grief and shame as they leave the garden’s beauty behind. The contrast between their past innocence and their suffering makes the scene especially powerful.</p>

                    <p>The prophet Jonah is painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling near the altar, sitting in a twisted pose that shows Michelangelo’s mastery of human movement. His story, where he survives three days inside a whale, is seen as a symbol of faith and a foreshadowing of Christ’s resurrection. Jonah’s presence on the ceiling connects the Old and New Testaments, reinforcing the chapel’s religious themes.</p>
